# Simple Quiz App

## What does this app do?

* This app will read questions from a Json file to ask the user
* The user's answers will be stored in LocalStorage
* The user's score will be read based on the answers in LocalStorage compared to the Json file

### What is index2, appjs2, and questions.json for?
These files are just me attempting to read an array instead of just an object from a json file and display it.
